# Services and properties

Each property is implemented as an Ansible role located in the [roles/properties](roles/properties) directory.


## Overview

Each service is managed by its own dedicated playbook, which calls a role for each property associated with that service.
The flow of the roles follows a consistent structure across all services.
This includes basically:

- install software
- generate SSL certificates
- set up configurations
- deploy content
- manage backups and restores


### Directory Structure

Configuration files and scripts for each property are stored in the `templates` directory, while property-specific variables can be found in `vars/main.yml`. Handlers for reloading and restarting Apache or Nginx are located in `handlers/main.yml`.


### Backups

For backup tasks, we created dedicated folder for each property on a DigitalOcean Bucket. The content for each property is backed up to this folder using [restic](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html). This process can be easily customized by adjusting the restic backup command.

Backups are run as part of the property role tasks. The tasks are located at [roles/backup_property](roles/backup_property).
For the `main` and `wiki` properties, a specialized task list `backup.yml` is employed within their respective roles ( at `/tasks`).

Backup tasks run as a cronjob. There is an additional cron, that prunes backup files based on different conditions.


### Restore backup

The restore process follows a similar structure to backup, providing a reliable way to recover data. When restoring, content is fetched from the backup folders on the DigitalOcean Bucket and returned to the appropriate locations.

The restore tasks are skipped initially on the first deployment of the property. The following should be passed to ensure the restore tasks are not run `--extra-vars "first_run=true"`. This is because on the first run there won't be any backed up data to restore from.

After the first deployment and a successful backup is done, next time when deployment is run data can be restored directly from the backup. When `first_run` variable is not passed or passed as `false` the restore tasks are run.


## Rsync Service

This service keeps repositories up-to-date by performing a git checkout via a cron job.
The update process is automated to ensure the latest version of the code is always available.

On the Rsync.php.net machine are 4 directories located:

`local/services`: The location of the scripts responsible for updating repositories and the rsync daemon config file.

`local/mirrors`: The directory where the repositories are stored and updated.

`/local/repos`: Another directory where the repositories are stored and updated.

#### Content workflow
rsync.php.net is a property. It pulls content from GitHub and puts the file to `/local/mirrors/{property}` on the rsync-machine.
The property itself pulls the data from this folder via `rsync`. All this is handled by cronjobs:

    A[Git Repository] -->|Cronjob: Pull updates| B[Rsync Service]
    B -->|Cronjob: Pull updates| C[Property Local Repository]
    C -->|Deploy to| D[Document Root]
```

To initialize `rsync` run the following playbook.
```sh
ansible-playbook initRsync.yml
```


## Services
